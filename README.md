Problem: Effective handling of excess food is more important than ever in a world that struggles with the contradiction of food shortage and waste. The staggering amount of food waste that occurs worldwide makes the problems of hunger, environmental damage, and inefficiencies in the economy worse. It is critical to address this urgent issue in order to build an equal and sustainable future for everybody.

Solution: To address the aforementioned problem, a strong and dependable food waste reduction and redistribution system was created. It mostly highlights four aspects:

1)Food Waste Reduction: Using a Random Forest Classifier, surplus food is categorized as either creating high or low waste. Food items are entered by the user, and the system predicts and alerts the donor if a food item is produced as high waste.A reduction in the quantity of excess food produced; a decrease in food waste.

2) Nutritional Analysis: Shows the Nutrient Content of the Surplus Food; allows for earlier analysis to guarantee that the food donated to the less fortunate is exclusively nutrient-rich.

3) Optimized Distribution Mechanism: Shortest path computation utilizing Minimum Spanning Tree approach; geographic mapping of the closest Donors to a specific Recipient (NGO)The optimized graph and the original weighted graph are visually represented. - Planning efficient routes is made easier. - Transportation expenses and time are cut. - By using optimized routes, carbon footprints are decreased.

4)  Real-time Database Connectivity: This feature effectively links local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with food donors who produce excess food. It expedites the process of redistribution and improves the timely and focused supply of surplus food to the most vulnerable.

In addition to these features, this project gives the user the ability to monitor how the Cross-Validation Score and the Model accuracy are affected by the addition of new data to the database, helping to prevent instances of Overfitting.
